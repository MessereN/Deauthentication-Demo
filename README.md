# Deauthentication-Demo
Used the scapy library to craft proper spoofed deauthentication packets to be sent out from access points to the designated target on my own internal network. In addition, the os library was used to ensure proper execution and termination of the attack. Also, the multiprocessing library was utilized to execute the attack in a concurrent manner.
